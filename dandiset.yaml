description: "This dataset was collected for the Dendritic Coupling project, as part
  of the Allen Institute's OpenScope project. \nPredictive coding hypotheses posit
  that perception is an active process whereby brain regions predict incoming sensory
  inputs, against which they are compared by other neural populations.  Mismatches
  between predictions and inputs result in error signals that can then be used to
  update the predictive model encoded in synaptic weights, thereby driving plasticity.
  Although increasing amounts of evidence are consistent with the general framework,
  many different algorithmic implementations have been proposed, requiring further
  experiments to test specific corollaries of these varied approaches.  One important,
  testable implication distinguishing some current theories involves the coupling
  strength in L2/3 and L5 pyramidal neurons between distal apical dendrites, which
  tend to receive top-down inputs that may include sensory prediction data, and their
  conjoined somata, which are often driven by bottom-up inputs. In particular, error
  signals are computed or else collocated in apical dendrites in some implementations,
  resulting in a quiescent subunit when the prediction matches inputs—zero error—and,
  thus, reduced dendro-somatic coupling during such times. In contrast, a separate
  proposal implies the opposite: Since many apical dendritic voltage signals can only
  reach their electrotonically segregated soma when facilitated by bursting induced
  by concurrent somatic sensory inputs, dendro-somatic coupling would instead be strongest
  when top-down predictions match bottom-up signals.\n\nOur experiment seeks to test
  these hypotheses by near-simultaneously imaging L2/3 and L5 somata and distal apical
  dendrites in mouse V1, LM, PM, and AM in transgenic lines that express GCaMP6f.
  \ Imaging four distinct areas allows us to also examine the consistency of the coupling
  rules, further putting the notion of a cortical canonical microcircuit to the test.
  \ By habituating animals to sets of visual stimuli with spatiotemporal patterns
  that are subsequently violated, we can evaluate the neural responses across the
  visual cortical hierarchy to help in adjudicating these important neuroscientific
  questions.\n"
